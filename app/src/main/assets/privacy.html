<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>This Privacy Policy ("Policy") outlines how GPSSample Mobile App ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and safeguards data obtained through the GPSSample mobile application ("GPSSample"). By using GPSSample, you agree to the practices described in this Policy.</p>

<h2>1. User-Provided Data</h2>
<p>GPSSample allows the user to collect data including text, images, or other information for users' survey purposes. This data is not provided or accessed by GPSSample development team.</p>

<h2>2. Location Information</h2>
<p>GPSSample collects precise device location, including while the app is running in the background, in order to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Record a breadcrumb trail of the enumerator’s route while traveling to and between households. The record feature must be initiated by the user and will remain in effect until the user either 1) stops recording or 2) terminates the application.</li>
	<li>Map household locations and points of interest</li>
	<li>Allow supervisors and data collectors to navigate back to the same households for follow-up surveys</li>
	<li>Support field work in areas with limited or no internet connectivity</li>
</ul>
<p>Location data may be collected:</p>
<ul>
	<li>While the app is open and in use</li>
	<li>While the app is in the background or the device is locked, such as when another app (for example, a phone call) is active</li>
</ul>
<p>This background location access allows GPSSample to continuously record GPS positions during field work so that accurate travel paths and household locations can be reconstructed later. The GPSSample app does not collect any location data if the app has been closed.</p>
<p>Users may revoke or change location permissions at any time in Android system settings. If background location access is disabled, GPSSample will not be able to record breadcrumb trails or track travel routes.</p>

<h2>3. Data Storage and Export</h2>
<p>Breadcrumb location data and survey data are stored locally on the device in an encrypted database.</p>
<p>Users may choose to export this data as encrypted files (such as JSON files) to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Device local storage</li>
	<li>User-designated cloud storage providers (for example, Google Drive)</li>
	<li>Supervisor or project servers</li>
</ul>
<p>GPSSample does not automatically upload data to third-party services without user action. GPSSample does not sell, rent, lease, or share location or survey data with advertisers or data brokers.</p>

<h2>4. How We Use Your Data</h2>
<p>Data collected by GPSSample is used solely to provide survey, mapping, sampling, navigation, and field-work functionality. We do not use data for advertising, marketing, user profiling, or analytics.</p>

<h2>5. Security</h2>
<p>We employ best practices for data security to protect data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. GPSSample uses 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standards (AES) for data encryption in transit. While we strive to ensure the security of data, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

<h2>6. Data Ownership</h2>
<p>Users (e.g., survey or study managers) retain ownership of the data they provide through GPSSample. We do not sell, rent, lease or otherwise share user data to third parties.</p>

<h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>GPSSample may integrate with third-party services or contain links to external websites. This Privacy Policy does not cover the practices of third parties, and users are encouraged to review the privacy policies of those services. Information about third-party services, including the two basemap services available: Mapbox and OpenStreetMap, and the applications GPSSample links with: ODK, Kobo, and ONA, are included in the Technical documentation.</p>

<h2>8. Changes to this Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Policy to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Users will be notified of significant changes, and the updated Policy will be effective upon posting.</p>

<h2>9. Contact Information</h2>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, or GPSSample, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:gpssample23@gmail.com">gpssample23@gmail.com</a>. Additional technical documentation is available on the <a href="https://github.com/GPS-Sample/gps-sample">GPSSample GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p>By using GPSSample, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
